For my first project, I will be creating a static read-only web page that contains recipes for classic Filipino dishes.
- Adobo
- Sinigang
- Bicol Express

I will be using links, images, and different font sizes.

In this project, I will demonstrate basic usage of HTML.

UPDATE:
After more than an hour, I finally finished my first website.
I ended up doing more than what I was supposed to do, I think I can make it look a bit better if I learn CSS, however, I at least added a background color to make it look appealing.

I am proud of my first work.
