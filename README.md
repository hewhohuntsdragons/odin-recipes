For my first project, I will be creating a static read-only web page that contains recipes for classic Filipino dishes.
- Adobo
- Sinigang
- Bicol Express

I will be using links, images, and different font sizes.

In this project, I will demonstrate basic usage of HTML.

UPDATE:
After more than an hour, I finally finished my first website.
I ended up doing more than what I was supposed to do, I think I can make it look a bit better if I learn CSS, however, I at least added a background color to make it look appealing.

I am proud of my first work.

after taking a month-long break in learning The Odin Project, i managed to start again last week and learned about CSS, in this update I added external CSS, <div>, and practiced using Git

(april 30 - 22:46)
i was having problems in using Git to commit, i kept deleting the directory and commiting over and over again. however, after much experimentation i managed to clean the directory and upload all the files again.
